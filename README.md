# Vaccination Covid-19 (PBI)

On this repository you can find a report on PBI where you can have the daily, and holistic view of the vaccination process against Covid-19.

I found the dataset on Kaggle and it was very compleate and simple. The community is really exited about this data.

You can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress/tasks?taskId=3176

Some of the countries do not have daily data but we have the total numbers.

If I get any extra free time, I guess I'll keep updating it.

Maikel.
